# üèéÔ∏è 3D Steering Wheel ‚Äî Gesture & ArUco Powered Virtual Racing Controller

Welcome to the future of sim racing! This project transforms your webcam, your hands, and a simple ArUco marker into a fully interactive, virtual steering wheel system. No expensive hardware needed ‚Äî just pure computer vision magic, hand gestures, and vJoy integration.

## üöÄ What Makes This Project Awesome?
- **Next-Gen Virtual Steering**: Control your racing games with real hand gestures and marker tracking ‚Äî feel like a pro, no wheel required!
- **Gesture-Based Throttle & Brake**: Accelerate and brake with intuitive hand movements. No pedals? No problem!
- **Gesture Shifting**: Shift up/down with a flick of your finger. Lightning fast, super cool.
- **Seamless vJoy Output**: Instantly compatible with most racing games and simulators.
- **Live Data Plotting**: Visualize your steering, throttle, brake, and latency in real time with built-in plotting tools.
- **Easy Customization**: Tweak sensitivity, deadzone, and more via a simple config file.
